## Install
### Linux
[Download the last release](https://github.com/edipox/wunderlistux/releases/latest).

Add an app shortcut. Create a file in ~/.local/share/applications called wunderlistux.desktop with the following contents:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Wunderlistux
Exec=/path/to/Wunderlistux-linux-x64/Wunderlistux
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=/path/to/Wunderlistux-linux-x64/resources/app/images/wunderlist.png

Or just copy the wunderlistux.desktop file from the release you downloaded. You have to edit the file anyway to fix the paths.
